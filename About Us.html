    <h2>
      Our Mission
    </h2>
      <p>
        We want to help you find a <i>reliable</i> buddy or two from down the block. 
        BlockBuddy started as an app project with the vision of helping communities bond together during extreme weather conditions to allow for easy collaboration with neighborhood residents.
      </p>
      <p>Our mission is to create a safe and reliable platform that promotes community involvement and supporting others in times of need.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>
      Why We Started
    </h2>
        <p>Have you ever had to wait outside for help to arrive during a snowstorm? Perhaps you're bringing home expensive equipment and shortly after getting off the bus, 
          heavy showers occur and you forgot your umbrella at home.</p>
        
        <p>Whether the situations above are relatable to you or not, our time is valuable and can't be taken back. By collaborating and helping each other within our communities, everyone benefits from interactions!
        </p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>
      How it Works
    </h2>
        <p>
          We refer to our users as "Buddies". Our buddies decide whether they would like to post a request or pick up requests from their local neighbours. 
          Put simply, we have 3 kinds of Requests:
        </p>

      <div>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Unpaid</th>
            <td>You will receive the highest form of gratitude from your local Buddy.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <th>Paid</th>
<td>Your time and effort will be compensated at the value you and the Requester have agreed on.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Urgent</th>
            <td>Typically used during extreme weather conditions, these requests will be highlighted and deleted after 12 hours.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
